# Mobile to Go.Data Integration
Mobile apps and survey tools are widely used by Go.Data implementers and other health initiatives for on-the-ground data collection, response, basic monitoring. Many of these tools are open-source and developed on similar frameworks (e.g., ODK, Kobo Toolbox, ONA, CommCare), so the available integration options are very similar.

**Use Case:**
**#4.** _As a MOH employee, I would like to integrate case data collected via my mobile survey tool so that I can monitor new case registrations in real-time and quickly follow up with new contacts._

---
## Solution Overview
In this reference implementation, we integrated a COVID-19 data collection form configured on [Kobo Toolbox](https://docs.openfn.org/) with Go.Data to deliver real-time case registration as mobile data is captured. See diagram below for the data flow. 
- Kobo Toolbox is a free mobile data collection app with offline support that is widely used in humanitarian response contexts. 
- Here we leverage the [OpenFn integration platform](https://docs.openfn.org/) to automate the data integration flow & quickly map Kobo data elements to Go.Data. OpenFn offers [open-source](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html) and hosted implementation options.

## Implementation Steps
1. Consider how to extract data from your mobile application ([see this section](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/topics/#8-integrating-with-mobile-data-collection-apps) for an overview of common options). In this implementation we configured a REST Service on Kobo Toolbox to automatically forward new Kobo Toolbox form submissions collected via mobile to a specified endpointâ€“our demo OpenFn integration layer. 
2. We then mapped relevant data elements from the Kobo Toolbox survey form to Go.Data `Cases`. See example [mapping specification](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qL3el6F2obdmtu2QKgcWYoXWsqBkhtII). In this step, it was important to determine the unique 
3. We then drafted an OpenFn integration script (or ["job"](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation.html#jobs)) to automate the data integration mapping whenever a new Kobo form submission is forwarded to the OpenFn project inbox via the Kobo REST Service. 

In [L21](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/docs-toolkit/interoperability-jobs/4-upsertCases.js#L21) we perform an "upsert" operation to (1) check if the case record exists, and then (2) insert/update the record in Go.Data accorndingly. We chose to check for existing Go.Data records using the `visualId` as we are also capturing the external `caseId` (e.g., `C19-930020123`) in Kobo Toolbox and can using this unique identifier for matching resources. 
```
upsertCase( //checks for existing cases & then sends PUT/POST request to Go.Data API Cases endpoint
    '3b5554d7-2c19-41d0-b9af-475ad25a382b', // outbreakId in Go.Data
    'visualId', //caseId - shared unique identifier 
    { data } //data mappings
  )
```
**See the full [job script](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/docs-toolkit/interoperability-jobs/4-upsertCases.js).** This job leverages the [language-godata](https://openfn.github.io/language-godata/) API adaptor, which offers helper functions like `upsertCase(...)` for quicker integration setup.
