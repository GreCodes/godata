# Mobile to Go.Data Integration
Mobile apps and survey tools are widely used by Go.Data implementers and other health initiatives for on-the-ground data collection, response, basic monitoring. Many of these tools are open-source and developed on similar frameworks (e.g., ODK, Kobo Toolbox, ONA, CommCare), so the available integration options are very similar.

**Use Case:**
**#4.** _As a MOH employee, I would like to integrate case data collected via my mobile survey tool so that I can monitor new case registrations in real-time and quickly follow up with new contacts._
