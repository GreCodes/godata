# Mobile to Go.Data Integration
Mobile apps and survey tools are widely used by Go.Data implementers and other health initiatives for on-the-ground data collection, response, basic monitoring. Many of these tools are open-source and developed on similar frameworks (e.g., ODK, Kobo Toolbox, ONA, CommCare), so the available integration options are very similar.

**Use Case:**
**#4.** _As a MOH employee, I would like to integrate case data collected via my mobile survey tool so that I can monitor new case registrations in real-time and quickly follow up with new contacts._

---
## Solution Overview
In this reference implementation, we integrated a COVID-19 data collection form configured on [Kobo Toolbox](https://docs.openfn.org/) with Go.Data to deliver real-time case registration as mobile data is captured. See diagram below for the data flow. 
- Kobo Toolbox is a free mobile data collection app with offline support that is widely used in humanitarian response contexts. 
- Here we leverage the [OpenFn integration platform](https://docs.openfn.org/) to automate the data integration flow & quickly map Kobo data elements to Go.Data. OpenFn offers [open-source](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html) and hosted implementation options.

## Integration Steps
1. Consider how to extract data from your mobile application ([see this section](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/topics/#8-integrating-with-mobile-data-collection-apps) for an overview of common options). In this implementation we configured a REST Service on Kobo Toolbox to automatically forward new Kobo Toolbox form submissions collected via mobile to a specified endpointâ€“our demo OpenFn
