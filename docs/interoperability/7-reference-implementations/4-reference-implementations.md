# Interoperability Reference Implementations
The following reference implementations were configured to demonstrate common interoperability use cases & potential solutions.
- Watch the [videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rf9TXCXkn8_XnjH4FcRsIGqDZ-UkVvdC) for demo implementations and additional how-to guidance. 
- See the [Use Cases](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/use-cases/) for a summary of the driving requirements and use cases. 
- API integrations were automated using open-source [OpenFn job scripts](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/tree/master/interoperability-jobs) and the OpenFn API adaptor [language-godata](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/language-godata). 
- To explore the jobs running in a live implemention hosted on OpenFn.org, or to deploy these yourself to prototype the different reference implementation solutions, **see the [Explore OpenFn](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata//explore-openfn/) page** to learn more.
