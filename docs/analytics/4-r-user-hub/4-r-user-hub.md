# R User Community for Go.Data users

## Scripts for automated reporting and HTML dashboards
- [See the R Reporting page](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/master/analytics/r-reporting) documentation which contains a script to easily connect to API and extract relevant database collections directly into your R console

## RShiny infrastructure
- _coming soon_ collaborators are now working on an adapting the above static reports to be a web-based dashboard that updates dynamically and will have more interactive components for filtering and drilling down into data on a more granular basis. A sample reference Shiny App will be made available on Github so that countries who would like to host their own RShiny application on their server can take it and adapt it with minimal updates required.

## Go.Data R Package
- _coming soon_ we are looking for collaborators who would like to develop Go.Data specific packages to ease data analyses and use! Please email godata@who.int if you are interested.
