# Go.Data dashboards in R

## Scripts for automated reporting and HTML dashboards
- [See the R Reporting page](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/master/analytics/r-reporting) documentation which contains a script to easily connect to API and extract relevant database collections directly into your R console

## RShiny infrastructure
- Collaborators are now working on creating a reference RShiny app to provide more interactive components for filtering and drilling down into data on a more granular basis.The template Shiny infrastructure will be made available on this [Github repository](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/master/analytics/r-shiny) so that countries who would like host it on their Go.Data server can take it and adapt it with minimal updates required.

## Go.Data R Package
- _coming soon_ we are looking for collaborators who would like to develop Go.Data specific packages to ease data analyses and use! Please email godata@who.int if you are interested.
