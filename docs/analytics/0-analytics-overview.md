# Go.Data Analytics Add-Ons & Dashboards

![](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/master/assets/analytics_connectors.PNG)

This documentation and linked [Github repository](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/tree/master/analytics) provides a suite of resources to enable and strengthen 
extraction, analysis and visualization of the data collected and stored via the Go.Data platform. This section is closely related to interoperability considerations and will make use of the API documentation there.

There are a number of considerations and possibilities for ways to extract your data and tech stacks to connect for data cleaning and analysis, including license-based or open-source dashboard products. [A high level document on our Community of Practice](https://sprcdn-assets.sprinklr.com/1652/a3450c7b-9a34-4fb1-a8d9-a07e02dc62af-2003567573.pdf) outlines a summary of these concepts.

We hope to keep this running repository of resources for Go.Data users performing advanced analysis and welcome contributions for various use-cases you have developed. If your analytics tool does not exist here we welcome you to add the documentation and code to this repo for others to benefit. Please see our [Contribution Template](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/master/docs/contribute/contribution-template.md) to submit a your use case!
