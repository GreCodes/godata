# Go.Data Data Extraction QuickStart
Considering extracting data from your Go.Data instance for advanced analysis, reporting and visualizations? See the below "Quick Start" steps for getting started. 

Go.Data provides a suite of options for extracting data -

2. Connect to API via scripts
- If leveraging Go.Dataâ€™s default settings, a self-documenting description of the API methods can be viewed using Loopback Explorer by adding /explorer to the end of any Go.Data URL.
- Go.Data uses LoopBack3 - See below additional resources for documentation site for tips and tricks on querying.
