# Interoperability Reference Implementations
The following reference implementations were configured to demonstrate common interoperability use cases & potential solutions.
- Watch the [demo videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rf9TXCXkn8_XnjH4FcRsIGqDZ-UkVvdC). 
- See the [Use Cases](../2c-integration-use-cases.md) for a summary of the driving requirements and use cases. 
- API integrations were automated using open-source [OpenFn job scripts](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation.html#jobs) hosted on a free account on OpenFn.org, which offers hosted and [open-source](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html) implementation pathways.
