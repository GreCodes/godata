# Integrating with mobile data collection apps 
Many Go.Data implementers leverage other mobile apps for offline-supported data collection and case management. Popular mobile apps include open-source options like Kobo Toolbox,
Open Data Kit (ODK), CommCare, Ona, and SurveyCTO. While these mobile tools offer different features and implementation options, they for the most part all support 2 main integration approaches: 
## 1. Integration via REST Service/ Webhook
Many mobile data collection features provide this feature to automatically publish or "push" data collected via mobile to an external data source. Users can therefore configure a REST service/ webhook 
to automatically forward new mobile form submissions in `JSON` or `XML` format to an external app whenever new data is collected. This approach enables real-time data integration and can 
be entirely controlled in the data source-side. 

See the [reference implementation]() for an example implementation where a [REST Service](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/rest_services.html) was configured in Kobo Toolbox to automatically forward new submissions to the 
[OpenFn](https://docs.openfn.org/kobo-toolbox.html) integration layer where automation was configured to transform & map the Kobo data into Go.Data via the API. 

## 2. Integration via APIs 
Many of mobile data collection tools also provide a REST API for enhanced data sharing options to extract mobile data collection. Data extraction options are limited to what is supported
by each app's API (for example, see [Kobo Toolbox](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/api.html) and [ODK API docs](https://docs.getodk.org/aggregate-data-access/?highlight=json#odk-api) to compare).  

## Resources 
1. See [reference implementation #4]() for specific step-by-step guidance with a real-world mobile integration example with Kobo Toolbox.
2. See [OpenFn 'Source Apps' docs](https://docs.openfn.org/source-apps.html) for summarized instructions on REST service setup and API documentation links for popular mobile tools like Kobo Toolbox, ODK, SurveyCTO, etc.
