# WHO Standardized Outbreak Templates
The real benefit of a tool like Go.Data is the ability to embed validated standards when performing case investigation and contact tracing across diseases. This includes alignment with WHO standards and technical teams when specifying variables and formats for data collection, such as the [WHO Outbreak Toolkit](https://www.who.int/emergencies/outbreak-toolkit)

To facilitate such standards, Go.Data contains outbreak templates for common diseases. Using an outbreak template, you can quickly add an outbreak to Go.Data with the relevant outbreak details and forms already completed.

To see more information om how to set up and use Outbreak Templates, please visit the [Go.Data User Guide](https://sprcdn-assets.sprinklr.com/1652/254f53e1-35b0-4ca8-8452-99a46c413cab-1176881866.pdf).
