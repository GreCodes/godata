# Welcome to the Go.Data GitHub Repository!

This is the project repo for sharing technical documentation and resources developed and used in the context of Go.Data deployments worldwide. 

You can find all repos connected to Go.Data tool in the WHO repo [here](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization?q=go-data&type=&language=) by filtering for topic "go-data".

Go.Data is a software for contact tracing and outbreak response developed by WHO in collaboration with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN).

In the *godata* repo, you can find:

## Go.Data Docs Site ([https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/))
-This centralized documentation site describes Go.Data Interoperability & Analytics and can point you to where various initiatives are living in Github relating to these topics.

## Go.Data Analytics Scripts
The *analytics* folder contains example scripts for extracting, cleaning, and running some basic analysis in R. Output at present includes flattened cleaned .csvs for case/contact linelists and an HTML dashboard displaying operational performance metrics for contact tracing by contact tracing supervisor and teams. 

## Go.Data API Scripts
This folder contains in it many example R scripts for GET/PUT/POST commands so that you can manipulate your Go.Data instance through the API, including bulk actions. We have used this for our training instances but think it could be helpful for others too.
