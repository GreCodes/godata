# Go.Data R analysis scripts

This is a sample folder hierarchy for running some Go.Data data retrieval, cleaning, analysis scripts. 

If you copy/paste this folder hierarchy into your C drive and double click the .Rproj, you can run the scripts in R and they will reference proper scripts in proper places.

## report_sources

This includes scripts for 
1. importing data from API and storing as dataframes
2. cleaning these dataframes and exporting to .csv files into clean data folder
3. running basic analysis for these data collections and outputting into .HTML dashboard

## report_outputs

This is where report outputs are stored.

## scripts

This is where other scripts and functions are stored; you do not need to open them up or run them separately, the scripts reference them where needed.

## data

This is where your data exports will be stored, in the "clean" folder. You can store other raw exports from Go.Data web interface in the "raw" folder.
