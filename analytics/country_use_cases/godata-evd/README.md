# Automated R Reporting Using Go.Data API for EVD Guin√©e

![](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/master/docs/assets/R_reporting_workflow.PNG)

Below we will outline further instructions for obtaining your data directly from your Go.Data instance application programming interface (API) using R, for further data cleaning and analysis for EVD Performance Reports and Inidcators on Contact Tracing. 
This process will provide you with cleaned, flattened excel files and sample dashboard output that you can adapt for your purposes. 

## NOTE: this builds on already existing SOP [here](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/blob/master/analytics/r-reporting/README.md). Other prerequisites are:
- Download R (version 3.6.1 or higher is recommended) here: https://www.r-project.org/
- Obtain valid Go.Data login credentials for the instance you are accessing, with the minimum permissions to _view_ data collections you are trying to extract (i.e if you want to extract laboratory data, you need the "Laboratory Personnel" role)
- Create folder directory on your local machine matching what is outlined in the SOP in an easily accessible place on your computer (i.e. Desktop)
