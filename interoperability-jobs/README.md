# Interoperability Reference Implementations using OpenFn Jobs 
This folder contains reference implementations of automated interoperability solutions to demonstrate common Go.Data interoperability 
use cases and example [OpenFn](docs.openfn.org) job scripts that automate common API and data exchange operations.

**Read the docs here:** https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/interoperability-examples/

These jobs leverage OpenFn API adaptors including [`language-godata`](https://openfn.github.io/language-godata/) 
and [`language-dhis2`](https://openfn.github.io/language-dhis2/).
