# Interoperability Reference Implementations OpenFn Jobs 
This folder contains [OpenFn](docs.openfn.org) integrations scripts or ["jobs"](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation.html#jobs) that automate common API and data exchange operations between Go.Data and external systems like DHIS2. These jobs were developed for 6 reference implementations to demonstrate common Go.Data interoperability use cases. 

**Read the docs here:** https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/interoperability-examples/

## API Adaptors
These jobs implement OpenFn API adaptors including [`language-godata`](https://openfn.github.io/language-godata/) 
and [`language-dhis2`](https://openfn.github.io/language-dhis2/).

## Explore the Integrations
[See the docs](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/interoperability-examples/) to see demos of the jobs in action. 

To prototype & run these jobs yourself, sign up for a free plan at [OpenFn.org](openfn.org/signup) or explore the open-source [OpenFn/microservice](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html) pathway.
